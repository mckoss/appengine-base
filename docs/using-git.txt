GET A STATIC COPY OF THIS PROJECT
==============================================================================
- Visit: http://github.com/mckoss/appengine-base
- Click the "download" button (to the right of the project name)
- Click on Zip format

INSTALL GIT ON YOUR MACHINE
==============================================================================
The master repository for the AppEngine-Base project is stored on GitHub:

	http://github.com/mckoss/appengine-base

Windows users can install the Git client: http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/

I use these settings for the install:
	- Add Git Bash Here, Add Git GUI Here
	- Run Git and included Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt
	- Use OpenSSH
	- Use Windows style line endings (this will store LF-terminated lines in the repository
	  while letting you use CRLF terminated lines in your Windows text editor) - note that
	  this could modify files that are mixed termination or CRLF terminated in an existing
	  repository.

Configure Git from the command prompt:
  - ssh-keygen -C "your@email.com" -t rsa
    (this will put your SSH keys in c:\Users\Username\.ssh\)
  - git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  - git config --global user.email "your@email.com"

- Sign up for a GitHub.com account.
  - https://github.com/account - add the contents of your .ssh\id_rsa.pub file
    to your list of SSH Keys

USE GIT TO RETRIVE A DIRECT COPY OF APPENGINE-BASE
==============================================================================
- git clone git://github.com/mckoss/appengine-base.git <aebase>
  (where <aebase> is the name of the directory you want to copy the project)

USE GIT TO CREATE YOUR OWN GIT-HUB BRANCH
==============================================================================
Recommended if you may want to offer your contributions back to the main
AppEngine-Base project.

- Visit: http://github.com/mckoss/appengine-base
- Click on the "fork" button to make your own version of this project
- git clone <your-project-clone-URL> <your-project-name>
- To push your committed changes to your git-hub project:
    - git push origin master
  
  Note, you may have to execute:
  
    - git remote rm origin
    - git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/appengine-base.git
  
  in order to set the origin branch properly (Why is this?).
